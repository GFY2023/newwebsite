Our on-site coordination team is our secret weapon to making your wedding flawless. From the very beginning, we love to offer recommendations and assistance in choosing all your amazing vendors, as well as be your sounding board for any question or idea you might want to bounce off us. We absolutely love it when our couples keep an open line of communication with us from the moment of booking to the moment you arrive for your weekend. We keep extensive files on all of our weddings, getting to know you and your ‘vision’ throughout your planning process, allowing us to serve you in the best possible ways.</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>This is something I love to do with you throughout your entire planning process. We usually do this through fun phone calls and emails, and I love it when my couples send me photos of decorating ideas so I can see inspirational ideas of their wedding vision. You can honestly never send too many as these allow me to get to know what you’re thinking of and what you love! Weddings are truly what we do 24/7 and we can help in ways you may not even realize. We always tell our couples the thicker your file is, the better we can help you bring your dream wedding to life.</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>On Friday afternoon at 4pm we meet with you and your bridal party, as well as anyone else you’d like involved in your ceremony procession (parent’s, children, etc) in the courtyard of your reception barn. This is the perfect time to bring everyone together and give a full run through of your wedding, it’s a lot of fun but more importantly, it’s the perfect way to help ensure everyone knows their timing, where to stand, how to walk, how to exit, it’s quite wonderful.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
                    <h3>Wedding Officiant</h3>
                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>We hire them directly, so you don’t have to worry about a thing. This includes your full rehearsal on Friday as well as your ceremony on Saturday, we’ve spared no expense to bring you the best! If you already have an officiant you’d love to work with, simply let us know and we’d can absolutely give ours the day off, you don’t have to use ours, they’re simply included if you wish. Once you’ve booked your wedding with us, our very next call is to your wedding officiant where we’ll book their services (letting them know we’ve now hired them for your wedding date) and they’ll get a hold of you from there. This allows you to communicate with them directly about how you’d like your actual ceremony wording to proceed.</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>The other thing that couples never quite think about until the moment it’s happening is your grand entrance into the reception as they announce you to your guests for the first time as a married couple (this typically takes place just prior to dinner time). It’s such an incredible and fun moment! We run you and your bridal party through a practice run so they’ll feel comfortable and at ease when this happens Saturday afternoon. They’ll know what side of the head table they’re seated on, if they’re sitting or standing when the bride and groom arrive, are they coming in solo or in pairs? It seems like such an easy thing to just let happen naturally but when that moment comes and we see the total panic in everyone’s faces as they’re about to be announced but have no idea what the best way to do things is (and it’s happening in like 5 seconds) both you and your bridal party will be happy to know that when the time comes, you’ll all look like stars!</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>For weddings that wish to do a rehearsal dinner, we’ve built a beautiful private area just beside the wedding barn. It will allow you and your bridal party an intimate setting, while still being close to the campground.</p>

                    <p>This wonderful suite is dedicated to you and your girls on the morning of your wedding. It features a beautiful 14ft long vanity counter with beautiful, large mirrors and perfect lighting for your hair and make-up crew. It also has a wonderful washroom, huge bridal changeroom, as well as a blue tooth stereo to enjoy your very own music. It’s the best place on the entire ranch come Saturday morning.</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>With all three cabins privately reserved for you, wedding parties usually dedicate one of them for the guys to get ready in on Saturday morning. This can be the same cabin you have chosen to stay in for the weekend, or one that is open for guests to use that evening, it’s totally up to you.</p>

                    <p>Each cabin is gorgeous and ready for ‘glamping’! They’re all done up to offer comfort to go with your camping. While they don’t have running water or power, each comes with a private BBQ just off their deck, dishes, indoor and outdoor dining set ups, beautiful beds and a private porch. They’re all set up with wonderful solar lighting (on a regular light switch), and as many comforts as we could think of.</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>Weddings include all camping fees so none of your guests have to pay to camp, you can even include it on your wedding invitations that the bride and groom have taken care of everything and the guests are welcome to camp for free! (guests really love that feature). Anyone who might like to stay here on site for the weekend but doesn’t have an RV might like to check out the local RV rentals (I have a list I can share with you.) We have tons of guests every weekend that will arrange to have an RV brought here for them, the company sets it up and the guests camp for the weekend, then the company comes back to pick it up. Tenting is also welcome!</p>

                    <p>About an hour before your ceremony, our parking attendant will be on-site to help guide guests coming in that day into the parking lot. He’s happy to answer questions and assist your guests in any way they might need. He’ll also direct any vendors coming in during that time to ensure they get to where they need to be.</p>

                    <p>And now the fun begins! We’ll meet you (and whoever you’d like with you) in the reception barn on Friday morning. This is when we’ll have fun creating your guests’ tables, ensuring your decorating vision has come to life, we’ll often have two tables going at one time so you create a few different looks. Once you’ve chosen your favorite elements and are in love with the design, you’re welcome to head to the campground and visit with your guest as we take it from there. When you come back a little while later, we can fine tune anything you’d like. You can add more décor, change things up, it’s quite easy. You simply say what you’d like, and we’ll make it happen! If you’d like to stay with us during the entire decorating process, that’s fun too!</p>

                    <p>Another great service is setting up your dessert table. No matter what you bring in for this, we can make it look incredible! We typically do full set up and display about ½ hour before your cake cutting, that way your photographer has a perfect chance to take some amazing shots before it gets touched. This also helps prevent ‘wondering hands’ as guests are always tempted to sneak a little something from your dessert display if they can. As soon as you’re cake cutting is complete, we open your full dessert bar for your guests. We’d also be happy to cut your wedding cake for your guests if you’d like, and display it beautifully on your desert table for them to enjoy. There’s no fee for cake cutting service, we find it works amazing at weddings and are happy to include it. Please let your dessert person (wedding cake baker) know that once they drop the cupcakes, wedding cake (or whatever you might be serving) at the barn (usually Friday afternoon or Saturday morning) we’ll be happy to take it from there. They are not required to set up your items for you, in fact, it truly works better if they don’t (like we said…wondering hands, lol). The most important thing is that the items are here by Saturday afternoon at the latest, you absolutely don’t need to pay their staff to set these up (including wedding cakes). They can simply instruct me on any finishing touches they’d like applied (flowers, cake topper, etc) and we’re happy to take care of all of this.</p>

                    <p>Loved by your guests, this service is open right from your ceremony time throughout the entire night. Everything included so you have nothing to worry about. Beverages include refreshing iced tea & lemonade as well as fresh coffee & tea.</p>

                    <p>We provide everything you’ll need for a successful bar experience including your bartender! All you need is your liquor & liquor license (which we can help you with of course). Due to liquor laws, we are not allowed to supply booze, so we’ve decided to include every other element we could think of! All your mix is also included! No more truckloads of hitting Costco and storing 20 flats of pop, juice, and mix for months before your wedding. We carry a huge stock of what guests love. And if we’ve learned anything after years of weddings, we know what guests ask for at the bar, lol. If you have any questions or want to make sure we carry a certain type of mix or item, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>Seeing the difference between weddings that have snack buffets available for guests, versus ones that don’t, we can honestly tell you it’s SO worth it! But it’s a lot of work (and stress) for couples to figure out what to bring, as well as the cost and organization that goes with it, so now we take care of that for you. The afternoon cocktail hour buffet is served right after your ceremony. As guests make their way to your reception barn, they’ll be greeted with a beautiful selection of light but delicious goodies, just a little something to tide them over until dinner, a perfect pairing as they begin to enjoy your bar beverages.</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>While your cocktail hour will offer lighter foods, your evening buffet will include delicious items designed to help soak up the delicious drinks they’ve been enjoying all day long. Usually served around 9:30pm, we love to appeal to all the cravings your guests might have from carbs to something salty and a little something sweet. Our snack buffets are carefully curated and ordered from local vendors. Always gorgeous and plentiful, they are absolutely one of the best bonus features that your guests will enjoy!</p>

                    <img src="images/KNWUyC2g.30740f2c.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrival">
                    <p>Your reception dinner is the only food we don’t include however, we have an amazing list of ones we can recommend for you, offering tons of food styles and menu options for every budget need. We love to spoil caterers in any way we can because we know how hard they work, so when they caterer to our location, they don’t need to worry about bringing dishware (and you don’t need to pay the rental fees often associated with dishware). While we do require your catering staff to provide dinner table clearing at the end of your guest’s meal, it’s a wonderful idea to let them know that they are not required to wash any of our dishes. As soon as dinner service is complete & guests tables are cleared, they’re welcome to pack up for the evening.</p>

                    <p>We maintain beautiful table service throughout the entire afternoon & evening, this especially comes in handy as your guest tables become filled with drink glasses, dessert dishes, etc. We love to keep your tables tidy and your guests happy. Please note that your caterer is responsible for clearing dinner plates after dinner service, but we take care of everything else before & after dinner, and for those few stragglers who hold onto their dinner plates a little longer, lol.</p>
