                <h3>Wedding Planning Services and Assists</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="services">Wedding Planning</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We are here to guide and support you during your entire wedding planning process, we love it! We can book a time to sit down with you (as many appointments as you’d like) or of course we can do this over the phone and email as well, which is the most common since most of our couples are from out of town or out of country, lol. Weddings are truly what we do 24/7 and we can help you in ways you may have never even considered. Everything from catering ideas, bar menu, DJ’s, accommodation ideas both on and off site, decorations, your wedding day timeline (from getting ready in the morning to setting up a great photography schedule throughout your day), late night buffets, I could go on and on. The fun ‘extras’ too like lawn games that guests love to play, even planned activities like an Axe Throwing event, oh ya, we can help with some pretty fun ideas, lol. Keep in mind, this is a company you hire, our insurance doesn’t exactly let you just start tossing axes around the ranch, oh my! Lol. We can offer other ideas too like amazing money saving tips and so much more! Never be shy to keep an open line of communication with us because the more questions we get from you, the more we get to know your wedding, and we love it! I always tell our couples, the larger your wedding ‘file’ is, the more we know about what you want, and that’s a really great thing!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">'Day of' Wedding Coordination!</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We’ll be with you and your guests during your entire day and throughout the evening to ensure everything goes as perfect as it should. There are so many details included in this service that I honestly couldn’t list them if I tried, lol. But I can promise you that we will take care of things in such a way that your only job will be to have the most amazing day of your life, and we’ll take care of the rest.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Check-in Service</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We do a full ‘check-in’ with our couples on Friday morning (10am in the barn, not TOO early, lol). This is where I get a chance to sit down with you and go over every detail of your wedding, fulling timeline schedule, all of your vendors, when/if they’re delivering, as well as any services we need to assist with or take care of for you. It’s one of my favorite things to do with you because you’ve probably had a million things running through your head for the last few months, and this is where I get the chance to take all of your stress away and let you know that we’ve got you. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Full setup service!</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We start decorating for your wedding on Friday morning, about 10-10:30am in the events barn.</li>
                            <li>This is when we’ll set up a ‘mock table’ to make sure your decorating vision has come to life, and we’ll take it from there while you hang out in the campground with your guests, so fun! Then come back a little while later and ‘fine tune’ anything you’d like. You can add more décor, change things up, it’s really quite easy. You just say what you’d like and we’ll make it happen. If you’d like to stay with us during the entire decorating process, that’s fun too!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Full takedown service!</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>By the time you wake up on Sunday morning we’ll already have all of your items gathered on the tables in a lovely way so that all you need to do is collect whatever goes home with you. You don’t even have to touch a broom or cleaning cloth, we do it all! Mom’s really love this part because they’re usually the ones who think they have clean up duty, lol.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Cocktail hour/appies & late night snack buffets (*we purchase these directly from local catering companies)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>These two snacks are so loved by guests that after years of doing this, we’ve decided to include them!</b> Seeing the difference between weddings that have these snacks available for guests, versus ones that don’t, we can honestly tell you that this is worth it, lol. But it’s a lot of work to now bring on two new vendors and the coordination that goes with it, so we’d sometimes see many wedding struggled with this. Do they do this through their dinner caterer? (that gets extremely costly because now you’ll also have travel and staff fees added on for several more hours). Do they bring they bring them in themselves? Yes, sometimes they would, but that also came with challenges, where to store the food in the meantime? Who does the prep and serving? Should they pick it up last minute (as if they don’t have enough last minute things to do, lol), where will they store it when here? Are they able to ensure that refrigerated items are kept food-safe while transporting over long distances? The stress goes on and on. Seeing our couples go through all the work involved in pulling these two meals together was tough. So now we’re including it! </li>
                            <li>Evening snack (often called a midnight buffet) is actually served around 9:30pm. We’ll actually gauge how your guests are doing (*cough…how they’re handling their alcohol, lol), if they look like they’re all getting a little too tipsy by 8:30/9pm we’ll serve this early to help them get some food in their stomach. If you’re dinner was a later one, and guests aren’t drinking a lot, we’ll serve it about 9:30/10pm. But 9:30 is generally the perfect moment. While you’re cocktail hour has wonderful selections of lighter foods, your evening one will offer more carbs and salts, giving them a little help to continue enjoying the evening (and hopefully not feel the hangover as much the next day too, lol). We make these little buffets so delicious that the guests just think they’re getting spoiled! They have no idea we’re actually looking out for them in an entirely different way as well.</li>
                            <li>Please note, we are not caterers and as much as we’d love to, we can not do your dinner as well, lol. Our snack buffets are amazing! Gorgeous, plentiful, and absolutely some of the best parts that your guests will enjoy! However, we are limited in our allowances due to licensing. We adhere to amazing items that do not require cooking and certain food handling elements, we simply purchase them from preferred locations and vendors (usually 2 or 3 so we can pick the best from the best, lol) but we do not have a licensed kitchen, and aren’t caterers, so we must let the professionals handle your dinner, lol.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Full dessert setup</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>o	Another great service is setting up your dessert table. We typically do full set up and display about ½ hour before your cake cutting, that way your photographer has a perfect chance to take some great shots before it gets touched. This also helps prevent ‘wondering hands’ as guests are always tempted to sneak a little something from your dessert display in the afternoon, lol. As soon as you’re cake cutting is complete, we open your full dessert bar for your guests. We’d also be happy to cut your wedding cake for your guests if you’d like, we display it beautifully on your desert table and everything.<br>*There’s no fee for this service, we find it works amazing at weddings and are happy to include it. Please let your dessert person/baker know that once they drop the cupcakes, wedding cake (or whatever you might be serving) off with us at the barn (usually Saturday morning) we’ll be happy to take it from there, they are not required to set up your items for you, in fact, it truly works better if they don’t (like we said…wondering hands, lol). We can even help by bringing these items in for you directly from our suppliers, never hesitate to ask!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Coffee and Tea services (supplies included)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This service will be offered to your guest right from your ceremony time and through the entire night. All of the cups and supplies will also be included so you have nothing to worry about.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Beverage service (supplies included)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is typically iced tea & lemonade that we make for your guests as a lovely drink option, but if you’d like different flavors or options simply let us know ahead of time so we can ensure we have it for you. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Floral setup</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Florists are amazing! And that usually means they’ve got many clients on the go the same weekend as you, lol. Please let them know they are absolutely welcome to simply drop the items off at the ranch, and we’d be happy to set up your arbor, ceremony site, head table, guest tables, absolutely everything! All you need to do is let us know what you’ve ordered and any instructions you’d like to give us as to where certain things go, and we’ve got it from there. Let us help save you those ‘set up’ fees! We can do this with you on Friday so you have time to ‘play’ with the placement of the arrangements if you’d like, as this allows you plenty of time to offer any changes you might desire.  If your greenery or florals are sensitive, we’ll simply do a mock table with you on Friday and ensure you’re 100% over the moon in love with it, then Saturday morning we repeat your perfect vision on the rest of your tables with the fresh greenery. This way you know you’re getting exactly what you love, and you get your vision (not your florists’…which can sometimes happen). All you need to do is arrange for the florist (or someone you know) to bring the arrangements and/or boxes of loose greenery to the ranch on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.</li>
                            <li><b>Artificial greenery &amp; florals:</b> Not sure if you want to go with real florals and greenery? That’s okay! We have TONS of options for you to choose from. About 80% of our weddings have been using (and loving) the artificial options we have in stock, so we keep buying more! Lol. We’ve also got quite a few weddings that will use our artificial greenery, then add in real flowers on tables either in vases or mixed throughout  our eucalyptus garlands, it’s a wonderful combo! We can honestly work with whatever you love. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Dishes for your reception night! (plates, cutlery, glassware).</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are no rental fees associated with the dishware of course. <b>While we do require that caterers are responsible for clearing your guests dishes after service is complete</b>, it’s a wonderful idea to let them know that they are not required to wash any of our dishes, we do that for you after your event...they'll be very pleased to hear this. It’s quite common for venues to ask that dishware be washed by the caterer, so mentioning that we have our own dishes AND that they don’t have to wash/rinse them after dinner service may help lower your catering quote as most caterers include that automatically.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Reception Table clearing</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once your caterer leaves for the evening, your guest tables will still have some stray plates and dinner items. We’re happy to clear tables for you throughout your night. We actually do this service for you throughout the entire afternoon & evening, this especially comes in handy as your guest tables become filled with drink glasses, solo cups, dessert dishes, etc. We keep your tables tidy and your guests happy.</li>
                            <li><b>&#42;</b>Please note that your caterer is responsible for clearing dinner plates after dinner service. Our table clearing service is for before &amp; after dinner, and for those few stragglers who hold onto their dinner plates a little longer, lol. Caterers always include this as part of their service , but it has become something we do need to mention to our couples now because as more and more caterers get to know how helpful we are, we are noticing that they are tempted to pass the dinner clearing service onto us, which we typically don’t find out until the moment guests are eating, and we are not staffed for this.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">The Bridal Dressing Suite</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This wonderful suite is dedicated to you and your girls on the morning of your wedding. It features a beautiful 14ft long vanity counter with beautiful, large mirrors and perfect lighting for your hair and make-up crew. It also has a wonderful washroom, huge bridal changeroom, as well as a blue tooth stereo to enjoy your very own music. It’s the best place on the entire ranch come Saturday morning, lol.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Vendor Tours</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If your caterer, photographer, videographer, florist, anyone at all, hasn’t been here before and would like to come see things in person, please feel free to have them contact us directly and we’d be more than happy to arrange a private tour for them.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3>Other Vendor Inclusions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="services">Wedding Officiant</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>We hire them directly</b>, so you don’t have to worry about a thing. This includes your full rehearsal on Friday as well as your ceremony on Saturday, we’ve spared no expense to bring you the best! If you already have an officiant you’d love to work with, simply let us know and we’d can absolutely give ours the day off, you don’t ‘have’ to use ours, they’re simply included if you wish.</li>
                            <li><b>Once you’ve booked your wedding with us</b>, our very next call is to your wedding officiant where we’ll book their services (letting them know we’ve now hired them for your wedding date) and they’ll get a hold of you from there. This allows you to communicate with them directly, setting up your ceremony time, rehearsal services (which we also pay for) as well as chat with them about how you’d like your actual ceremony wording to proceed. We have one in particular that our couples absolutely adore working with! And we think you’ll really enjoy him too, such a fun personality, he’s amazing!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Rehearsal Service (for wedding &amp; grand entrance)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Ceremony Rehearsal:</b> On Friday afternoon we’ll meet with you and your bridal party, as well as anyone else you’d like involved in your ceremony procession (parent’s, children, etc). This is the perfect time to bring everyone together and give a full run through of your wedding, it’s a lot of fun but more importantly, it’s the perfect way to help ensure everyone knows their timing, where to stand, how to walk, how to exit, it’s quite wonderful.</li>
                            <li><b>Grand Entrance:</b> The other thing that couples never quite think about until the moment it’s happening is your grand entrance into the wedding barn as they announce you to your guests for the first time as a married couple (this typically takes place just prior to dinner time), it’s such an incredible and fun moment! We run you and your bridal party through a practice run so they’ll feel comfortable and at ease when this moment arrives. They’ll know what side of the head table they’re seated on, if they’re sitting or standing when the bride and groom arrive, are they coming in solo or in pairs? It seems like such an easy thing to just let happen naturally but when that moment comes and we see the total panic in everyone’s faces as they’re about to be announced but have no idea what the best way to do things is (and it’s happening in like 5 seconds, lol) both you and your bridal party will be happy to know that when that moment comes, they’ll look like stars!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Full Bartending Service</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Remember, we pay them directly</b> so that’s one less vendor you have to think about, and it’s all included</li>
                            <li>*Note: due to insurance, we cannot allow outside bartenders, if your friend is an awesome bartender that’s great! Please let them know they’re welcome to join your wedding as a guest, and our bartenders are happy to take care of them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Bar supplies (Everything from cups, shot glasses, napkins, drink tickets, you name it!).</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All you’ll need is your liquor & liquor license (which we can help you with of course), we’ll have everything else for you.</li>
                            <li>All of your mix! No more truckloads of hitting Costco and storing flats and flats of pop, juice, and mix. We carry a huge stock of what weddings love. If you have any questions, or want to make sure we carry a certain type of mix or particular item, please don’t hesitate to ask. We bring in items from 3 different suppliers, but if you have a signature drink, or would like to have something special brought in, please let us know and we’re happy to stock it if we can get it.</li>

                <h3>Guest Services</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="services">An entire weekend dedicated to you and your guests!</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check in is anytime after 2pm on Thursday, and check out is 12pm on Sunday.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Accommodations</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Weddings include all camping fees</b> so none of your guests have to pay to camp, you can even include it on your wedding invitations that the bride and groom have taken care of everything and the guests are welcome to camp for free! (guests really love that feature)</li>
                            <li>Guests who might like to stay here on site for the weekend but don’t have an RV are welcome to check out the local RV rentals (listed on our camping page). We have tons of guests every weekend that will arrange to have an RV brought here for them, the company sets it up and the guests camp for the weekend, then the company comes back to pick it up. These companies typically have a 3 night minimum which is why your weekend is absolutely welcome to start as early as 2pm on Thursday! Check isn’t until 12 noon on Sunday.</li>
                            <li>*Note: While guest arrival is anytime after 2pm on Thursday, RV Rental companies are welcome to deliver their RV anytime Thursday morning. And while guest checkout is 3pm on Sunday, your RV Rental company is welcome to pick up as late on Sunday as they like. We know that they also deliver to provincial and private campgrounds, and they typically have strict times that the RV companies need to abide by, so we allow them to arrive earlier than guests, and pick up after the guests have departed, this way they have more flexibility with us which we are happy to offer them.</li>
                            <li>On-site shower house, outdoor vanity, flush washrooms….just because you’re on a ranch, doesn’t mean your guests can’t be spoiled!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Parking Attendant</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>About an hour before your ceremony, our parking attendant will be on-site to help guide guests coming in that day into the parking lot. He’s happy to answer questions and assist your guests in any way they might need. He’ll also direct any vendors coming in during that time to ensure they get to where they need to be.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3>What else?</h3>

                            <li><b>We have 3 cabins, all are now included for free!</b> As the wedding couple, you’re free to choose which one you’d like (if you’d like to use one). Each cabin is gorgeous and ready for ‘glamping’! The cabins are done up to offer comfort to go with your camping. While they do not have running water or power, they do come with a BBQ, dishes, indoor and outdoor dining set ups, beautiful beds and a private porch. If you’d like to have a full kitchen and private bathroom, we’re absolutely happy to recommend one of the amazing local companies that offer RV rentals, they’re wonderful! They’ll bring the RV right to the ranch for you, set it all up, and then pick up it after your stay.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="services">Ranch Tours</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Of course we love to give our wedding couples tours! But what if you want to come back in a few months or a year and see it all again? Or what if you’re in town and Mom and Dad or other friends &amp; family want to come check things out, we’re happy to book that in for you. Never be shy about wanting to come see the ranch</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>And of course we are here for you during your entire weekend. We take care of everything behind the scenes (garbage, recycling, making sure your vendors are cared for, etc).</p>
