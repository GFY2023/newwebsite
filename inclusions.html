                    <p>As weddings are our passion, helping you throughout your entire planning process is one of our favourite parts. Everything from building and customizing your ‘day-of’ timeline to picking out your favourite décor elements. We love it when our couples send us photos of decorating ideas from how they’d like their ceremony site to look, the colors of florals they’re considering, and even what kind of table settings they’re in love with. You can honestly never send too many photos and sample ideas, as these allow us to get to know what you’re thinking of and what you love! Weddings are truly what we do 24/7 and we can help in ways you may not even realize. We always tell our couples the more information in your file, the better we can help you bring your wedding vision to life!</p>

                    <p>Weddings include all camping fees so none of your guests have to pay to enjoy the weekend with you. Anyone who might like to stay here onsite for the weekend but doesn’t have an RV might like to check out the local RV rentals (I have a wonderful list of local companies I can give you). We allow RV rental companies to arrive prior to our Thursday opening time, allowing them the opportunity to deliver and set up their accommodation before your guests even get here. *Please know that tenting is also welcome!</p>

Each cabin comes with a queen size bed (cabin 1 has 2 queen beds), a futon (giving you another queen size bed if needed), a private BBQ just off the deck, dishes, indoor and outdoor dining tables and chairs. All three cabins are set up with wonderful solar lighting (on a regular light switch), and as many comforts as we could think of.</p>

This is when everyone will get comfortable with their timing, know which order they’ll be walking in, where to stand when they arrive at the ceremony site, how to proceed to your signing table, and even how to exit. It’s the perfect time to calm everyone’s nerves, knowing they’ll be guided the entire way.</p>

                    <p>A really fun moment that happens at every wedding is your grand entrance into the reception as your MC announces you for the first time as a married couple. Full of energy and excitement, this typically takes place just prior to dinner as your evening is officially started! During your Friday rehearsal, we’ll run you and your bridal party through this so they’ll feel comfortable and at ease when this happens Saturday afternoon. They’ll know what side of the head table they’re seated on, are they’re sitting or standing when the bride and groom arrive? Are they coming in as pairs or a group? It seems like such an easy thing to just let happen naturally but when that moment comes it’s a bit of a panic moment as they’re about to be announced but have no idea what the best way is to do things, and it’s happening in like 5 seconds, oh dear! Now, both you and your bridal party will be happy to know that when the time comes, you’ll all look like stars!</p>

It will allow you and your bridal party an intimate setting, while still being close to the campground. Located just steps above the wedding barn, you’ll be close to the fridge and prep area should you need to do any last minute plating for this meal. Need some ideas of what to serve? Simply let us know and we’d be happy to give you lots of wonderful ideas that many weddings have done to make this meal delicious (and best of all, stress free).</p>

We’ll meet you (and whoever you’d like with you) in the reception barn on Friday morning as we begin creating your guests’ tables, ensuring your decorating vision has truly come to life. We’ll often have two tables going at one time so you can create a few different looks. Once you’ve chosen your favorite elements and are in love with the design, you’re welcome to head back to the campground, relaxing and enjoying friends and family as we take it from there. When you come back a little while later, we can fine tune anything you’d like. Want to add more décor? Change a few elements around? It’s quite easy. You simply say what you’d like, and we’ll make it happen!</p>

                    <p>This is my second favorite room to show couples. Literally filled to the roof, we’ve got tons of greenery, florals, and everything in between for you to choose from. Once you pick your favorite elements and colors, we’ll create individual floral designs for each of your guest tables and head table, your arbour and ceremony site and more. With the endless possibilities in this room alone, we can create the most beautiful pieces just for you.</p>

                    <p>We provide everything you’ll need for a successful bar experience including your bartender! All you need is your liquor & liquor license (which we can help you with of course). Due to liquor laws, we are not allowed to supply alcohol, so we’ve decided to include every other element we could think of. All your mix is also included! No more truckloads of hitting Costco and storing 20 flats of pop, juice, and mix for months before your wedding. We carry a huge stock of what guests love, and if we’ve learned anything after years of weddings, we know what guests ask for at the bar, lol. If you have any questions or want to make sure we carry a certain type of mix or item, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

                    <p>Seeing the difference between weddings that have snack buffets available for guests, versus ones that don’t, we can honestly tell you it’s SO worth it! But it’s a lot of work (and stress) for couples to figure out what to bring, as well as the cost and organization that goes with it, so now we take care of that for you. The afternoon cocktail hour buffet is served right after your ceremony. As guests make their way to your reception barn, they’ll be greeted with a beautiful selection of light but delicious goodies, just a little something to tide them over until dinner, a perfect pairing as they begin to enjoy your bar beverages.</p>

                    <p>While your dinner meal isn’t something we’re able to provide, we have an amazing list of caterers we can send you, offering wonderful choices sure to help you plan the perfect menu for your guests. As they are one of your main vendors, we love to spoil caterers in any way we can because we know how hard they work. We’re happy to provide your guests dishware so the caterers don’t need to worry about bringing bins of plates (and you don’t need to pay the rental fees often associated with it). While we do require your catering staff to take care of plate clearing at the end of your guest’s meal, it’s a wonderful idea to let them know that they are not required to wash any of our dishes. As soon as dinner service is complete & guest tables are cleared, they’re welcome to pack up for the evening.</p>

                    <p>Whether it’s simply setting your desserts out, or adding the finishing touches to your wedding cake, we take care of all of this for you. No matter what you’ve chosen to serve, we can make it look incredible! As soon as you’re cake cutting is complete, we open your full dessert bar for your guests. We’d also be happy to cut your wedding cake for your guests if you’d like and display it beautifully for them to enjoy. There’s no fee for cake cutting service, we find it works amazing at weddings and are happy to include it. Please let your dessert person (wedding cake baker) know that once they drop the cupcakes, wedding cake (or whatever you might be serving) off at the barn (usually Friday afternoon or Saturday morning) we’d be happy to take it from there. They are not required to set up your items for you, in fact, it truly works better if they don’t set these out ahead of time so that we can ensure everything is kept safe until the perfect serving time. They are welcome to instruct us on any finishing touches they’d like applied (flowers, cake topper, etc) and we’re happy to take care of all of this.</p>

Please note that your caterer is responsible for clearing dinner plates after dinner service, but we take care of everything else before & after dinner, and for those few stragglers who hold onto their dinner plates a little longer, lol.</p>
