                      <p><b>The Campground</b></p>
                      <p>Our exclusive campground will open at 2pm in anticipation for you and your guests arrival.  Since weddings include all camping fees, none of your guests need to ‘check in’. They can simply find a site they love and set up for the weekend. All three of our cabins are also included, so please feel free to reserve these for yourselves, or any guests you’d like to share them with. *Please note that as the wedding couple, you are responsible for the cabins (and any losses or damages).</p>
                      <p><b>What Else Happens On Thursday?</b></p>
                      <p>This is the perfect time to start unloading anything you’ve brought for your wedding (liquor and wedding items) into the barn. Simply send me a text to let me know you’re done unloading and our staff will come lock up the liquor in the bar. <b>*</b>Any liquor you’d like to reserve for yourselves throughout the weekend must be kept with you at your campsite.</p>
                      <p>Once your campsite is set up, and you’ve unloaded things out of your vehicle, it’s officially time to relax and have fun! You’re welcome to text me anytime, but for the most part, I love to simply let you enjoy this time with your friends and family as they arrive for your amazing weekend!</p>

                    <p><b>10am</b></p>
                    <p>This is when I meet with our wedding couple in the event barn. <b>*</b>Please bring any essential paper work with you at this time. Odds are pretty good that I know your wedding inside and out by now, so all we’re really doing is finalizing the details and ensuring I know all the wonderful details to take excellent care of your wedding. It’s one of our favorite things to do with you because we know you’ve had a million things running through your mind the last few months, so this is where we get the chance to take all of your stress away and let you know that we’ve got you! After our check in, the fun begins as we open up both décor rooms as now we get to help you create your guests tables, ensuring your decorating vision has come to life. We’ll often have a couple tables going at once so you can create a few different looks. Once you’ve chosen your favorite elements, we’ll finalize the table design. This also helps us know how to accent the rest of your reception area. Once you’re in love with the design, you’re welcome to head to the campground and visit with your guest as we take it from there. When you come back in the afternoon, we can ‘fine tune’ anything you’d like. You can add more décor, change things up, it’s really quite easy. You simply say what you’d like and we’ll make it happen! If you’d like to stay with us during the entire decorating process, that’s fun too!</p>

                    <p><b>3:45pm (for 4pm rehearsals)</b></p>
                    <p>We’ll meet with you and your bridal party, as well as anyone else you’d like involved in your ceremony procession (parent’s, children, etc). Not only is this a great time for our team to meet everyone involved, it’s also the perfect way to ensure your bridal party knows their timing, where to stand, how to walk, how to exit, it’s quite wonderful! And best of all, it will calm everyone’s nerves as they now feel ‘ready’ for the real thing. </p>
                    <p>We’ll also rehearse your grand entrance into the wedding barn. This is that exciting moment when you and your bridal party get to make an exciting entrance to kick off your evening. During your rehearsal on Friday afternoon, we’ll take you and your bridal party through a practice run so they’ll feel comfortable and at ease when this moment arrives. Not only will they know what side of the head table they’re seated on, but now we can help answer the small questions like if they’re sitting or standing when the bride and groom arrive, what order do they stand in, etc. This entire process takes about 1 hour, so you should be complete by 5pm.</p>
                    <p>For weddings that wish to do a rehearsal dinner, we’ve built a beautiful private area just beside the wedding barn. It will allow you and your bridal party to have an intimate setting, while still being close to the campground. </p>

                    <p><b>The Dressing Suite</b></p>
                    <p>On Saturday morning, we’ll open the private dressing suite for you and your bridal party. It features a beautiful vanity counter with mirrors, daylight lighting, a large change room, as well as well as a private bathroom. A Bluetooth stereo is ready and waiting as you enjoy the lounge area inside, or the private deck area. There's plenty of room for your photographer to join you and capture those memorable "getting ready photos". Wedding couples usually like to dedicate one of the cabins for the guys to get ready in. Sometimes this is the same cabin our wedding couple has chosen to stay in, or sometimes they reserve one just for the ‘getting ready room’ for the guys, and then open it for guests to stay in that evening, it’s totally up to you.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>The Arbour</b></p>
                    <p>Our staff will finalize your ceremony site décor, making sure everything is perfect for you and your guests. With an entire building dedicated to florals and fabrics, we can create just about any arbour look you could possibly dream of. Simply show me a photo or two of what you’d like your arbour to look like and we’ll bring your vision to life!</p>

                    <p>About 15 minutes before your ceremony, your bridal party will meet me in the barn where we’ll make sure they are ready to go. We’ll go over these little details during your Friday rehearsal, not to worry. We’ll be there to open your barn doors in unison (completely unseen by your photographer) and guide everyone with perfect timing as they set out of the barn and begin their walk down the isle.</p>

                    <p><b>Wedding Photos</b></p>
                    <p>After your amazing ceremony, family photos typically take place on the lawns between the ceremony site and the wedding barn. This usually takes about 30 minutes, then your photographer will steal you and your bridal party away for private photos.</p>
                    <p>During this time, your guests will get to enjoy the afternoon mingling in the barn and courtyard area, perhaps playing lawn games if you’d like to bring some? And your bar will be open! Many weddings like to provide their guests with some light afternoon snack options. Our team would be happy set this up for you! Simply let us know what items you’d like served, and we’ll display them up on a beautiful table, as well as refresh supplies as they run low. We’re also happy to offer some amazing and popular choices if you’re not sure what to serve. (*Please note this buffet is now included in our 2024 package).</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Your Grand Entrance</b></p>
                    <p>About 15 minutes prior to your scheduled dinner time, your MC will have your guests seated in the barn as you and your bridal party meet me at the mingling deck as we get ready for you to get the evening started, this is so much fun! </p>

                    <p>As your dinner wraps up (provided by your chosen caterer of course), your speeches and perhaps even your first dance may commence. Your wedding day timeline is personalized to each wedding couple, so everything happens in the exact order you’d like it to.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>The Dessert</b></p>
                    <p>A great service we love to include is setting up your dessert table. We typically do full set up and display about 1/2hr prior to your cake cutting, that way your photographer has a perfect chance to take some amazing shots before guests dive in. This also helps prevent 'wandering hands' as guests are always tempted to sneak a little something from your dessert display in the afternoon. Please let your dessert company know that they’re welcome to simply drop off the items with us (cake, cupcakes, etc) and we'll be happy to take it from there. If your cake baker would like to set up the cake themselves, we completely understand and will ensure they have what they need, but we’ll keep the rest of your dessert items tucked away until set up time so we can keep everything safe for you. Once your cake cutting is complete, we can open your dessert bar for your guests, and would be happy to cut your wedding cake if you’d like. There is no cost associated with this service, we find it works amazing at weddings and are happy to include it.</p>

                    <p>Once your caterer leaves for the evening, your guest tables will still need attention as they enjoy dessert, late night goodies, and of course drinks from the bar. We're happy to clear your tables throughout the evening.</p>
                    <p><b>Late Night Snack</b></p>
